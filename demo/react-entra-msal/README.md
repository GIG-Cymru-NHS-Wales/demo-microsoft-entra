# React Entra MSAL (Microsoft Autenthication Library) demo

This application demonstrates the requirements for a React app to utilise an Entra application registration using an authorisation code flow with PKCE [(proof key for code exchange)](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-pkce)

## Prerequisites
Before getting started with the demo you will need:
- An client Id and tenant Id for an Entra application registration
- NPM or a similar package manager if you intend to run the demo application natively
- Docker if you intend to utilise the docker files to run the demo application in a container

## To configure the demo app
Once you have downloaded the demo application open the `.env` file to update the environment variables to be able to connect to your Entra application registration
```dotenv
VITE_APP_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here
VITE_APP_TENANT_ID=https://login.microsoftonline.com/your-tenant-id-here
VITE_APP_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000
```
*You can find your Client Id and Tenant Id in the overview page of your Entra application registration.*

*The redirect uri must be configured in the Application Registration -> Authentication page:*
*Platform=`SPA`, Redirect URI = `http://localhost:3000`*

*We are using port 3000 for the demo but you can configure this as needed*

## To run the demo app locally
If would like just to run the React client application, open a terminal in the `React-Entra-MSAL` directory and run the below:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Once the development server is running a browser should be launched to take you to the demo application. If not open `http://localhost/:3000` in your browser.

## To run the demo app using Docker
To run the React client application in a docker container you can follow the steps below.
If you are using Windows make sure you have Docker Desktop installed and the engine is running before continuing.

Open a bash terminal in the same directory as the dockerfile and run the below to build the image:
```bash
docker build -t react-entra-msal .
```

Once the image has built run the below to start the React dev server within your docker container:
```bash
docker run -p 3000:80 react-entra-msal
```
*This is binding the external port 3000 to the default nginx port 80 within the container*

# Building a React Application with MSAL

### Creating the initial react application
For this demo application we are using Vite to create our vanilla React application.

```bash
npm create vite@latest react-entra-msal react-entra-msal -- --template react
cd react-entra-msal
npm install
```

### Install the MSAL package
```bash
npm install @azure/msal-browser @azure/msal-react
```

‚ùóYou may find that the MSAL package throws an error during install if your current React version is greater than React 18. 
To resolve this error you can rollback your React version with the below script:

```bash
npm install react@18 react-dom@18
```

### Add a .env file
In the root of the newly created React project create a (or open your) `.env` file and add the below:
```dotenv
VITE_APP_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here
VITE_APP_TENANT_ID=https://login.microsoftonline.com/your-tenant-id-here
VITE_APP_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000 #adjust this if needed
```
*As we are using Vite it is important that the environment variables start with `VITE_`*

### Setup the Authentication provider
In the src folder create an `authConfig.js` file.
```javascript
// src/authConfig.js
export const msalConfig = {
    auth: {
      clientId: import.meta.env.VITE_APP_CLIENT_ID,
      authority: import.meta.env.VITE_APP_AUTHORITY,
      redirectUri: import.meta.env.VITE_APP_REDIRECT_URI,
    },
    cache: {
      cacheLocation: "localStorage",
      storeAuthStateInCookie: false,
    },
  };

  export const loginRequest = {
    scopes: ["User.Read"],
};
```

Then you need to wrap your React application with the MSAL provider in the `main.jsx` file. This imports the configuration from the previous step into the MSAL provider and give the React app access to the MSAL functionality.
```javascript
// src/main.jsx
import { StrictMode } from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import './index.css'
import App from './App.jsx'
import { PublicClientApplication } from '@azure/msal-browser'
import { MsalProvider } from '@azure/msal-react'
import { msalConfig } from './authConfig.js'

const msalInstance = new PublicClientApplication(msalConfig);

async function startApp() {
    await msalInstance.initialize();

    createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
        <StrictMode>
            <MsalProvider instance={msalInstance}>
                <App />
            </MsalProvider>
        </StrictMode>,
        );
}

startApp();
```

### Add Authentication logic
 We can now use React hooks from the MSAL package to import authentication functionality.
 ```javascript
 // src/App.jsx 
import './App.css'
import { useMsal, useIsAuthenticated } from '@azure/msal-react'
import { loginRequest } from './authConfig'

const App = () => {
  const { instance } = useMsal();
  const isAuthenticated = useIsAuthenticated();

  const handleLogin = () => {
    instance.loginPopup(loginRequest).catch((e) => {
      console.error(e);
    });
  };

  const handleLogout = () => {
    instance.logoutPopup();
  };

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <h1>Welcome to Entra Auth App</h1>
        {!isAuthenticated ? (
          <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
        ) : (
          <>
            <p>You are logged in!</p>
            <button onClick={handleLogout}>Logout</button>
          </>
        )}
      </div>
    </>
  )
}

export default App;
 ```

 #### useMsal
 For our demo application we are going to utilise the instance from the useMsal hook. This contains login and logout methods which will use the MSAL configuration to connect to Entra and handle the authentication process for us.

 *It is worth noting that we are using instance.loginPopup and instance.logoutPopup, this will launch the authentication in a popup box. We can also use instance.loginRedirect and instance.logoutRedirect to redirect the user to an authentication page without the popup*

 #### useIsAuthenticated
 React MSAL uses the useIsAuthenticated hook to track whether a user's authentication state. By pulling isAuthenticated out of the hook we can then user that to dynamically render content based on the authentication state.

 ### Test the application!
 At this point you can run the development server and test the authentication functionality. After launching the below script the app should load in a browser. 
 ```bash
npm run dev
 ```
Now pressing the Login button should show the login dialog and allow you to choose an account to sign in with. 

Once you return to the app the logout button should now be rendered in place of the login button. Pressing the logout button will show a dialog to allow you to choose an account to sign out.
